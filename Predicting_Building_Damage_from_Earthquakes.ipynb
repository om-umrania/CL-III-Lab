The task is a multi-class supervised learning problem to predict the damage classification of buildings as a result of the Gorkha earthquake in April 2015. The earthquake in question was 7.8 in magnitude and occured near the Gorkha district of Gandaki Pradesh, Nepal. Almost 9,000 lives were lost, millions of people were instantly made homeless, and $10 billion in damages about half of Nepal's nominal GDP was incurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis is applied to one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics. The target variable has 5 classes, labelled 'Grade 1':'Grade 5' which each represent the different scale of damage sustained to the building.\n",

Bambo and cement foundations tend to see an inverse relationship with grade, grade 1 is the most popular and this decreases as the grade classification increments. Mud mortar foundations have a very different relationship with damage grade in which it follows the proportions of the overal grade variable.
